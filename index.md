# Welcome To The openSUSE Kernel Site

An introduction into the SUSE kernel is in the
[wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/Kernel). On this site, you can find basic
information about each kernel branch links to git trees and package
repositories. Use the links in the navbar to navigate the site.

Have a lot of fun...
